## Analysis of Mental Health Hospitalizations in Brazil (2019–2025)

This project performs an exploratory analysis of public data on hospitalizations related to mental health disorders in Brazil between 2019 and 2025.

## Objective

Apply basic public health data analysis concepts, exploring temporal trends and regional differences.

## Data Sources

- Publicly available CSV data
- Period: 2019–2025

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Analyses Performed

Temporal evolution of total cases

Comparison of total cases by region

Evolution of cases by region over time

## Results and Discussion

The analysis of hospitalization data related to mental health disorders in Brazil between 2019 and 2025 reveals more than numerical trends. It reflects a period marked by profound transformations in how we live, relate, and cope with psychological distress.

**What the numbers reveal over time**

In 2019, records show a more stable pattern, serving as a snapshot of the pre-pandemic scenario. From 2020 onwards, there is a sharp increase in hospitalizations, coinciding with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Social isolation, fear of illness, family losses, financial instability, and disruption of daily routines created a high-pressure emotional environment for the population.

In the following years, even with vaccination progress and gradual return to in-person activities, numbers remain high. This suggests that the mental health impacts did not disappear after the most critical pandemic phase. On the contrary, many effects seem to have persisted, indicating a difficult and uneven adaptation process in the post-pandemic period.

**Before, during, and after the pandemic**

Before the pandemic (2019): data show a more controlled level of hospitalizations, reflecting a reference scenario.

During the pandemic (2020–2021): a consistent increase in cases occurs, possibly related both to worsening psychiatric conditions and reduced early access to mental health care.

After the pandemic (2022–2025): records remain high, which may indicate greater mental health awareness, higher demand for professional help, and an accumulation of unmet needs from previous years.

This behavior reinforces the idea that global crises leave marks beyond the immediate event, especially regarding mental health.

**Regional differences and inequalities**

Case distribution among Brazilian regions shows higher concentration in the Southeast and Northeast. These numbers should not be interpreted solely as higher prevalence of mental disorders, but also as reflections of factors such as population density, socioeconomic inequalities, access to health services, and the reporting capacity of information systems.

This highlights the importance of future analyses that consider population-adjusted rates, allowing fairer comparisons between regions and deepening understanding of mental health inequalities in the country.

**The role of the digital world in contemporary distress**

The analyzed period also coincides with intensified use of digital technologies, remote work, and social media. While these resources have been essential to maintain educational and professional activities, they have also contributed to increased stress, anxiety, and feelings of isolation, especially in a context of hyperconnectivity and constant productivity pressure.

Thus, the analyzed data can be seen as part of a broader scenario in which biological, social, and technological factors intertwine, reinforcing the complexity of current mental health challenges.

**Why this matters**

Beyond identifying trends, this analysis emphasizes the need to treat mental health as a public health priority. The project demonstrates how public data can be used to reveal relevant patterns, generate hypotheses, and support evidence-based decisions.

Numbers help tell a story that, in the real world, involves people trying to cope with losses, changes, and increasing pressures. Transforming these data into accessible and contextualized information is an essential step toward more effective public policies and more human-centered prevention strategies.

**Final considerations**

This project shows that health data analysis goes beyond technique. It requires sensitivity to interpret numbers within the historical and social context in which they were generated. By combining data, programming, and critical reflection, it is possible to build analyses that not only describe the past but also help envision more conscious paths for the future of mental health in Brazil.
